### 🧠 About Me

Hi, I’m **Saffi** — a problem-solver who loves turning complex ideas into working code.

👾 Currently building: **Office Metaverse** — a 2D virtual workplace built with **FastAPI**, **PostgreSQL**, **Pixi.js**, and **React**.

💡 I play multiple roles:
- 👨‍💻 **Backend & API Engineer** (FastAPI, PostgreSQL, SQLAlchemy)
- 🤖 **AI Integrator** (OpenAI, LangChain, MojoAuth)
- 🔧 **DevOps Guy** (CI/CD pipelines, GitHub automation)
- 🧭 **Product Manager & Scrum Lead** (ClickUp & JIRA wrangler)

I treat every commit like a checkpoint in a quest. My FYP team might be new to the tech world, but we’re shipping features like bosses.
